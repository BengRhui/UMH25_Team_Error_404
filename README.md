# Team Error 404 (UM Hackathon 2025)
Hi, everyone! Welcome to our group's `GitHub` repo. All our ideas, documents and code will be recorded here.

## Preliminary Round - Domain 2
For the preliminary round, our group has prepared a conceptual diagram to demonstrate our approach to the problem in Domain 2.

Attached is the problem and objective statement for Domain 2 (UMHackathon, 2025).

>### Problem Statement
>Alpha Strategies Using HMM or ML
>
>### Objective
>Develop a Machine Learning (ML) model that analyzes on-chain data from various sources (e.g. CryptoQuant, Glassnode, Coinglass) to generate an alpha trading strategy that maximizes profit.
>The model should effectively extract implicit indicators from noisy data to generate profitable trading signals.

Our conceptual diagram is as shown:
